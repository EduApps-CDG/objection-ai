Objection.ai is a solo-ready AI client for objection.lol that runs full Ace Attorney-style trials without a human Game Master. Powered by `@google/genai`, it generates the case, testimony, evidence, and courtroom twists in real time so every session feels like a fresh episode.

### HOLD IT! Infinite Cases, Zero Waiting

Skip the scripts and scheduling. **Objection.ai** spins up a complete Ace Attorney-style case *on demand* so you can jump straight into cross-examination.

You play as the lone Defense Attorney against an AI that hides the truth. Hit start and a brand-new episode unfolds every time.

### TAKE THAT! Stream-Ready Highlights

* **📺 Solo-first content:** Jump in instantly without scheduling. Boot, record, and crack a case live.
* **🔄 New case every run:** New victims, weapons, witnesses, and twists powered by `@google/genai`.
* **🎭 Reactive testimony:** Press statements, present evidence, and watch the AI improvise under pressure.
* **⚡ Fast setup:** Minimal install time so you can start playing sooner.
